This was created as a django project for testing purposes. Before I was granted access to the
Minerva Computing Cluster, I needed to debug and test my code using my local machine as a server.
Because of this, the directory structure is also somewhat confusing. This is yet another data
visualization project that pulls data from .tsv files and plots it in interactive line graphs.
